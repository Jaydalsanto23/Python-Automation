# Python-Automation

## Objective

The objective of this project was to develop proficiency in essential programming skills by working with file handling, string manipulation, and list operations. The project involved reading from and writing to text files, processing and modifying strings, and iterating through lists to manage data effectively. By applying conditional logic to filter and update content, and employing debugging techniques to troubleshoot issues, participants enhanced their ability to write clear and maintainable code. Additionally, the project provided practical experience in managing file paths and using string methods, which are crucial for data manipulation and software development.
